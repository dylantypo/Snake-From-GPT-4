# Snake Game Created with ChatGPT-4

### Message from ChatGPT
This code provides a basic snake game with a simple retro style. 
You can run the code, and it will display a snake game window with a white background, a green snake, and red food. 
Use the arrow keys to control the snake. 
If you want to modify the game's appearance or behavior further, you can do so by changing the constants, colors, or other parts of the code.

Some ideas for expanding the game or enhancing its retro style:

1. ~~Add a score display that shows the player's current score, which could be based on the snake's length.~~
2. ~~Add a game over screen with the option to restart the game.~~
3. ~~Implement different levels of difficulty, such as faster snake movement~~ or additional obstacles.
4. Add sounds or music to create a more immersive experience.
5. Create a retro-style pixel art for the snake, food, and background.
6. Customize the game window's appearance, such as adding a retro border or ~~using a pixelated font.~~

Feel free to experiment and modify the code as needed to create the snake game you envision.
